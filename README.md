# Twitter-Airlines-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Twitter data to determine the sentiment of tweets related to airlines. The primary goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiments expressed in the text. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer opinions and experiences, which can help airlines improve their services and customer relations.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib nltk scikit-learn mlxtend wordcloud 
```
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset and place the Tweets.csv file in the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis

```bash
jupyter notebook 
```
4. Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to analyze the sentiment of tweets and visualize the results.
   
## Results
The project includes accuracy scores and classification reports for the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
Confusion matrices are visualized for both classifiers to demonstrate their performance in predicting sentiments.
